BUILDING OUR GEM
CHECKLIST:
Plan your gem, imagine your interface.
Start with the project structure - google.
Start with the entry point - the file run.
Force that to build the CLI interface.
Stub out the interface.
Start making things real.
Discover objects.
Program.

So I want to build a command line interface for all recipes that will return the video recipes

Take in an input from the user

Show a list of what the user wants

After we have that list, ask if they want to know more about something on that list.

SO USE git branch to check what branch you’re in
Use atom . to open up the branch you’re in
Then add any changes normally up to git push
Then use git checkout master to go back to the master
Then type in git merge first_branch in the master to merge the two and update any changes you made.
